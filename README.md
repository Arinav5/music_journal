The website we plan on building is a playlist/music library where users can comment on songs, albums, and artists that they listen to or recently found. 
It will be like a journal of music reflecting what they thought of different artists and songs at different times in their life. 
They can choose to share these comments or they can be made private. We might implement a catalog of songs/artists that can be tagged in the review. 
Additionally users might have friends that they can add to share their reviews with.
